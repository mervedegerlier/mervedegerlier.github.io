<div id="about">
<h3>
	I am currently a freshman at Yahya Akel Science High School.
	<br>
	 I started out curious. I was amazed by nature and the sky. I was curious about stars and galaxies and space. 
	 <br>
	 My curiosity was further enhanced by the books I read. Books were everything to me, especially in middle school.Then I met the computer and asked the question: “How does a computer work ? “. This was the moment when my curiosity turned into passion.
	 <br>
	  I started learning software on my own. Then I thought, Why don’t I share what I know with other people, and I started a blog. In my blog I share scientific and technological events that I like and think others will like, as well as book suggestions.
	  <br>
	  That way, maybe there will be someone who will be interested in science by reading my writings. I’m very happy to keep this butterfly effect going. 
	  <br>
	  I love science and technology because I think it’s great to do something for the benefit of people. I am currently producing educational content in Python and writing on my blog. Besides these, playing the violin, painting and writing short stories are among my hobbies.
	  <br>
	   I want to be a good engineer in the future and inspire people my age.

<h3>I thought that visually impaired individuals face many challenges in everyday life. 
	<br>
	I have prepared a technological mechanism to find a solution to this problem. When individuals approach the door, the alert system will activate and sound alerts will be sent.
	<br>
	 That way there won’t be any bumps or injuries. I wanted to add an artistic feature to this project . I put windows on my door. And I left it all to your imagination. You can place a famous picture on the windows or a cartoon character that your child likes. 
	 <br>
	 I’ve made the windows bright from the inside, so you’ll have a nightlight covered with your favorite artwork all night long. When you approach the door, the amount of light will increase and when you get up at night you will be able to find the way without hitting anywhere.

My project was invited to the regional exhibition in the TÜBİTAK research project competition in physics.
